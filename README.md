This is a garden mapping application that allows you to track plants and trees with an interactive map interface. The application uses Leaflet for the map visualization and stores plant data in a JSON format with local persistence through localStorage.

The interface provides an intuitive way to add new plants by clicking directly on the map while in edit mode. Each plant has detailed information including growth characteristics, care requirements, and seasonal information. The color-coded markers make it easy to distinguish between different plant types at a glance.

The application features a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices, with smooth animations that provide visual feedback during interactions. The plant information cards display all the essential details in an organized way with appropriate icons and color-coding for different plant attributes.
